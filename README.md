# Rimworld-Mod-Boilerplate
##  A developer-ready modding boilerplate for RimWorld.

**What is it?**
- A very simple and already prepared modding template for [RimWorld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/).

**Dependencies**
- None.

**How does it work?**
- The source of this project contains an already working RimWorld mod workspace, that comes with the ``Harmony`` and ``RimWorld`` NuGet packages already built-in.
- Simply clone the source, and start modding like you would always do.

> [!NOTE]
> This source comes with vscode tools already prepared inside, that allow the developer to build the project, and some suppression rules to automatically hide non-important folders. If you aren't using vscode, feel free to remove the ``.vscode`` folder should you want to.
